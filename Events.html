    <h1>Short Report</h1>
    <p>
Our group held 2 events. The first one was intended to be held on 7th of November at 13:00 in
school number 17. There were 20 students. However, because some unexpected problems
occurred- many students were absent on that day since it was the last day before the holiday- the
event time was changed. With all the unexpected changes, group members Ilknur, Sara and
Kanan could not participate in the event. Group member Jamal held the event alone. The event
started with a short speech about ADA university using the presentation provided. Then the
instructions and the course were explained. Next, students started to solve the levels by
themselves throughout the session of 45 minutes. But it was not a satisfactory occurrence so we
as a group decided to hold another event. Since the holidays started the next event could only be
held in a training center with the students from different courses. The second event took place on
the 12th of November in a training center called “Legend School” with 10 participants.
Everything went well this time. Participants were given certificates for completing the course
and the first 3 places got prizes.</p>
